*nanoPLM* follows the following workflow from product development and manufacturing:
1. Technology research (Patents, scientific publications, existing products, catalogues)
2. Concept (Quick drawing (hand/powerpoint) with all its components and external effects)
3. Product safety assessment (Directive 2001/95/EC, risk assessment, ...)
4. Preliminary design (analytical calculations)
5. Detailed design (3D CAD, manufacturing and assembly drawings, simulation)
6. Testing (if necessary (safety, functional))
7. Manufacturing (in-house/ outsourced, development and manufacturing of manufacturing aids)
8. Quality assurance (100% control/ sample)


## Manage your product data in a small team
- Material id, image, name, description
- 3D CAD, drawings
- Patent documents (IP)
- Product brochures
- Machinery directive, CE marking, risk assessment, instructions manual, declaration of conformity
- Price buying, price selling
- ...
